Topic -> Importance of Devops

Hook(Question,Bold Statement,Relatable)
Hello LinkedIn community,
Should Dev and Ops work in silos or not? 

Make it Personal
While learning the concepts of Devops, i realized how crucial it is for Dev and Ops  teams to work together as a unit rather passing the work back and forth.
Traditionally, software development was seen as a project to complete and hand it over to the operations team to maintain but that approach rarely creates a great product.

Give Value
With DevOps its different, team ownership and stable teams makes software development more like product development and less like project management.

DevOps behavior includes shared ownership, collaboration, embracing change and data-driven response.

DevOps is more about culture, people and mindset as much as tools and processes.

End With Engagement
What do you guys want the Traditional way where Dev and Ops work in silos or DevOps behavior?
